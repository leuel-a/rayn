# rayn

**rayn** is an experimental Node.js addon that bridges JavaScript and [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) using native bindings.  

The goal of this project is to learn and explore how C/C++ can interface with Node.js through the V8 engine, by building a minimal, idiomatic wrapper around a simple graphics library.

This is not a production-ready library, but a learning journey into low-level integration between native code and JavaScript.
